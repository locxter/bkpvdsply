This is a bike POV display using readily available parts.

## Dependencies

I generally try to minimize dependencies, but I'm a one man crew and can therefore only support Ubuntu/Debian as I'm running it myself. Anyway, you need to have the following packages installed for everything to work properly:

- Arduino IDE as a way to compile the Arduino code. Install it with `sudo apt install arduino`.
- Arduino ESP8266 LittleFS uploader for uploading the data. Install it via the [installation guide](https://github.com/earlephilhower/arduino-esp8266littlefs-plugin).

## How to build it
